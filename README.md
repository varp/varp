### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm a software developer and IT consultant. Love PHP, Go, JS. I'm doing a lot of backend stuff and a little bit of DevOps. Also, I'm managing a small group of developers on a daily basis as a team-lead.

I'm contributing to several OpenSource projects pinned here and accidentially to others, which interests me at some point of a time.
